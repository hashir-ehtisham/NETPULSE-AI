## üì• Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository

cd NETPULSE-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## üîß Requirements to Run VBS Script for Network Health Logging
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable Serial Communication**
   - Ensure Raspberry Pi sends data via serial (UART) to a COM port.
   - Identify the correct COM port (e.g., COM3).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install & Register MSComm32.ocx** (For Serial Port Communication)
   - Place `MSComm32.ocx` in:
     - `C:\Windows\System32\` (32-bit Windows)
     - `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` (64-bit Windows)
   - Register via Command Prompt (Admin):
     ```bash
     regsvr32 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\MSComm32.ocx  # for 64-bit
     regsvr32 C:\Windows\System32\MSComm32.ocx  # for 32-bit
     ```
   - Restart your system after registering.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Microsoft Excel Installed**
   - The script logs data into `network-data.xlsx`.
   - Ensure Microsoft Excel is installed on your PC.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **VBScript Enabled**
   - Run `wscript.exe` to verify VBScript is enabled.
   - Disable antivirus restrictions on `.vbs` scripts if necessary.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Correct File Path & Permissions**
   - Ensure the script saves data to:
     ```
     D:\Apps by Hashir\Network Health Prediction\network-data.xlsx
     ```
   - Update the directory path if needed before execution.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Script**
   - Double-click the `.vbs` file to execute.
   - If using CMD, navigate to the script directory and run:
     ```bash
     cscript script.vbs
     ```
   - If no COM port is connected, the script may fail or loop indefinitely.

üí° **Tip:** If MSComm32 is not working, use PowerShell or Python for serial communication. üöÄ
